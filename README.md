# hello-world
This is a layman's attempt to visualize primary energy resource trade flows and nuclear reactor construction. Hope you will get to enjoy!

I endeavor to create visualizations of my master thesis research at the University College London, UK.
Having previously worked solely in STATA, I am now learning R and Javascript. The learning curve is incredible. I am amazed by the virtuous supply of information, amazing to-do tutorials and cool projects on the Internet.

The biggest thanks, even at this stage, goes to a very good elementary school friend, who has motivated me to up my game and create user-friendly visualizations.

If you end up being interested in my work, whatever it may look like in due time, contact me!
Have a lovely weekend,
Fabian
